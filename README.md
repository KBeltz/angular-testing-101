[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-testing-101)

## Types of Tests
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- End to end tests

### Unit Tests
Tests an individual function or component (in other words, a single _unit_); all functions or components needed to run the test are _mocked_. 

### Integration Tests
Integration tests verify that different parts of the application work well together, such as components and services.

### End to End Tests
End to end tests replicate user behavior throughout the entire application from end to end, verifying that a user flow works as expected.

## Testing Frameworks
- Jest is a Behavior Driven Development testing framework built on top of Jasmine, and it is used for unit and integration testing
- Cypress is an end to end testing framework
